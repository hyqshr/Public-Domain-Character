## 📖 What is public domain?

**Public domain** refers to a status or designation of intellectual property, such as books, music, art, or other creative works, where the underlying content is not protected by copyright or any other form of intellectual property rights. When a work is in the public domain, it means that it is free for anyone to use, share, modify, and distribute without seeking permission from or paying royalties to the original creator or copyright holder.
